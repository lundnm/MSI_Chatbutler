- Developed an Information Retrieval chatbot using LangChain to assist UMSI master’s students.
- Integrated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and various UMSI degree-related documents.
- Provides guidance on degree requirements, course prerequisites, mastery courses, and other degree-related topics.
- Includes official degree requirement sheets for each of the four MSI tracks.
- Offers personalized assistance by allowing users to input their class schedules and preferences for customized schedule creation.
- Limitations: The chatbot does not remember user responses and context over time, requiring users to include all necessary information in each prompt to receive accurate output.
